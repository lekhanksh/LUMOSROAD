Project Overview
Project Name: LumosRoad Tagline: Safety-first AI navigation for Bharat
LumosRoad is an AI-powered navigation and safety platform designed for Indian roads, with a strong focus on rural, semi-urban, and high-risk areas. Unlike traditional navigation systems that optimize only for speed or distance, LumosRoad prioritizes user safety, road reliability, and real-time risk awareness.

Problem Statement
Current navigation systems optimize primarily for speed and efficiency. In Bharat, this leads users through:
	•	Poorly lit rural roads
	•	Accident-prone highways
	•	Isolated or unsafe areas at night
	•	Roads with poor surface quality or seasonal risks (monsoon flooding)
This creates safety risks, especially for women, elderly users, night travelers, and rural commuters.

Target Users
	•	Rural and semi-urban commuters
	•	Night-time travelers
	•	Women and elderly users
	•	Delivery partners and field workers
	•	Emergency service users

Core Features & Requirements
1. User Onboarding & Permissions
Functional Requirements
	•	User login via phone number
	•	Location access permission
	•	Optional emergency contact setup
	•	Language selection (English + Indian languages)
Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Simple, low-bandwidth onboarding
	•	Works on low-end Android devices

2. Home & Navigation
Functional Requirements
	•	Search destination via text or voice
	•	Show multiple route options
	•	Display safety score for each route
Safety Score Inputs
	•	Crime density
	•	Accident history
	•	Lighting availability
	•	Road condition
	•	Time of day

3. Route Comparison
Functional Requirements
	•	Compare routes based on:
	◦	Safety score
	◦	Distance
	◦	Estimated time
	•	Highlight “Safest Route” as default

4. Guardian Mode (Active Navigation)
Functional Requirements
	•	Real-time location tracking
	•	AI-based anomaly detection:
	◦	Sudden stops
	◦	Route deviation
	◦	Unusual delays
	•	Periodic safety check-ins

5. Safety Alerts & Anomaly Detection
Functional Requirements
	•	Push alerts on detecting risk
	•	Prompt user confirmation ("Are you safe?")
	•	Auto-trigger escalation if no response

6. SOS & Emergency System
Functional Requirements
	•	One-tap SOS button
	•	Share live location with emergency contacts
	•	Optional integration with local emergency numbers

7. Settings
Functional Requirements
	•	Manage emergency contacts
	•	Toggle Guardian Mode sensitivity
	•	Language and notification settings

Constraints
	•	Must work in low-network zones
	•	Minimal battery consumption
	•	Privacy-first data handling

Success Metrics
	•	Reduction in unsafe route usage
	•	Guardian Mode adoption rate
	•	SOS response time
	•	User retention in rural regions
